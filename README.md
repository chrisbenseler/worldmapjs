worldmapjs
==========

World Map in javascript
Based on https://github.com/madewulf/MigrationsMap.net
Required jQuery and Raphael (http://raphaeljs.com/)

##How it works
The scripts load async a file with countries coordinates in json format and draw them in an SVG element.
Note: the script was first implemented for a world map, but it works with any kind of map.

##Browser Support
Tested in:
- Firefox 19
- Chrome 25
